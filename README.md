# sqlzoo-practice
Hands‑on SQLZoo exercises for beginner to intermediate practice.

This repository contains my solutions to SQLZoo’s interactive tutorials.  
Each lesson is organized by topic—SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc, and includes:

- The original exercises
- SQL solutions 
- Sample outputs/ screencaps for query results

I use this collection to track my progress as a self‑taught data analyst, demonstrate my SQL skills, and serve as a reference for future projects.
