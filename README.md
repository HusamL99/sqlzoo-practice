# sqlzoo-practice
Hands‑on SQLZoo exercises for beginner to intermediate practice. All exercises use the built‑in SQLZoo schema (no local data file needed).

This repository contains my solutions to SQLZoo’s interactive tutorials.  
Each lesson is organized by topic—SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc. 

I use this collection to track my progress as a self‑taught data analyst, demonstrate my SQL skills, and serve as a reference for future projects.
